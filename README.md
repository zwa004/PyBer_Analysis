# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to compare the fare amounts of 3 city types over 4 months. 

## Results
Urban Pyber has more rides and drivers while also having higher total fare amounts than the other city types (1,625, 59,602, $39,854.38 respectively). While having the least number of rides, rural city types have at least 4x higher average fare per ride and rider than the other 2 city types ($34.62 and $8.06).

## Summary
Markup :
 * Recommendation 1: Advertise more in suburban areas for the month of March to increase total fares

 * Recommendation 2: Increase the fare amount for urban areas to capitalize on the higher number of rides.

 * Recommendation 3: Figure out how to add more riders in the earlier part of the months for all cities.
